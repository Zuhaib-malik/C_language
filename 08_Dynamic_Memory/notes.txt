üß† **Dynamic Memory in C: Beginner to Advanced Guide**

---

üîç What is Memory in C?

Before we talk about **dynamic memory**, let‚Äôs understand how memory works in a C program.

When you run a program in C, memory is divided into four parts:

1. **Code Segment**: Stores the compiled code.
2. **Stack**: Stores local variables and function call info.
3. **Heap**: Used for **dynamic memory allocation**.
4. **Data Segment**: Stores global and static variables.

---

üå± What is Dynamic Memory?

**Dynamic Memory** means **allocating memory at runtime**, instead of defining memory size when you write your code.

In simple terms:

> You **ask the system** to give you some memory while your program is **running**, and you can **return** it when you‚Äôre done.

üì¶ Static vs Dynamic Memory

| Static Memory             | Dynamic Memory                                |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Allocated at compile time | Allocated at runtime                          |
| Fixed size                | Flexible size                                 |
| Uses stack                | Uses heap                                     |
| Automatically managed     | Manually managed using `malloc`, `free`, etc. |

---

üìå Why Use Dynamic Memory?

‚úÖ When you don‚Äôt know how much memory you‚Äôll need (e.g., input size unknown).
‚úÖ To handle large data (stack has limited size).
‚úÖ To create flexible data structures like **linked lists**, **trees**, etc.

üß∞ Functions for Dynamic Memory in C

| Function    | Purpose                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `malloc()`  | Allocates uninitialized memory        |
| `calloc()`  | Allocates memory and initializes to 0 |
| `realloc()` | Resizes previously allocated memory   |
| `free()`    | Frees (deallocates) memory            |

---

üìå 1. `malloc()` ‚Äì Memory Allocation

```c
int *arr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
```

* Allocates memory for 5 integers.
* Returns a pointer to the memory block.
* If memory allocation fails, returns `NULL`.
* Memory is **uninitialized** (contains garbage values).

---

üìå 2. `calloc()` ‚Äì Contiguous Allocation

```c
int *arr = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
```

* Allocates memory for 5 integers.
* Initializes all values to **zero**.

---

üìå 3. `realloc()` ‚Äì Resize Memory

```c
arr = (int *)realloc(arr, 10 * sizeof(int));
```

* Resizes memory block to hold 10 integers.
* Preserves previous values if possible.

---

üìå 4. `free()` ‚Äì Free Allocated Memory

```c
free(arr);
```

* Releases memory to prevent **memory leaks**.
* Always call this when memory is no longer needed.

üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ‚ùå Don't Do This                               | ‚úÖ Do This Instead                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Forget to `free()` memory                     | Always `free()` after use                                    |
| Use memory after `free()`                     | Never use freed memory                                       |
| Forget to check if `malloc()` returned `NULL` | Check for `NULL` before using pointer                        |
| Cast `malloc()` in C                          | Don‚Äôt cast in C (optional): `int *p = malloc(...);` is valid |
| Mix `malloc` with non-heap variables          | Keep stack and heap use separate                             |
| Memory leak in loop                           | Free memory inside the loop or at right place                |

‚úÖ Best Practices

‚úîÔ∏è Check for NULL

```c
int *ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
if (ptr == NULL) {
    printf("Memory not allocated!\n");
    exit(1);
}
```

‚úîÔ∏è Free What You Allocate

```c
int *ptr = malloc(100);
free(ptr);
```

‚úîÔ∏è Use `valgrind` or tools to check memory leaks

If you are using Linux, tools like `valgrind` can show if you forgot to `free()` memory.

üìà Advanced Concepts

üß± Dynamic Arrays

```c
int n;
scanf("%d", &n);
int *arr = malloc(n * sizeof(int));
```

üîÅ Realloc in Loops

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    arr = realloc(arr, (i+1) * sizeof(int));
    arr[i] = i;
}
```

üß¨ Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs

Dynamic memory is essential in data structures:

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};

struct Node *head = malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
```

---

 üì¶ Real-World Example

 üìù Read a Line of Unknown Length:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char *line = NULL;
    size_t size = 0;

    printf("Enter a line: ");
    getline(&line, &size, stdin);

    printf("You typed: %s", line);

    free(line);
    return 0;
}
```

üîö Final Advice

* **Always free what you allocate.**
* **Never access memory after freeing it.**
