/* 
File I/O:
    Allows programs to read from and write to files stored on disk, enabling data persistence beyond the program's execution.
        
    Key Concepts:
        File Pointer (FILE *): A pointer used to manage a file stream, linking the program to the file on disk.
        File Modes: Specify how a file is opened (e.g., "r" for read, "w" for write, "a" for append, "rb" for binary read).
        
Common Functions:
    fopen(): Opens a file and returns a FILE * pointer.
    fclose(): Closes an opened file.
    fprintf(): Writes formatted output to a file.
    fscanf(): Reads formatted input from a file.
    fread(), fwrite(): Used for reading and writing blocks of data (often for binary files).
    fgetc(), fputc(): Used for single character I/O with files.
    fgets(), fputs(): Used for string I/O with files.
    fseek(), ftell(), rewind(): Used for navigating within a file.
Basic I/O Example (Standard I/O):
