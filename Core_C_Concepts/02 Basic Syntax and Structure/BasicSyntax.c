// 1. Documentation:
// Comments, typically starting with // or enclosed in /* */, explain the code's purpose. 
// 2. Preprocessor Directives:
// Lines starting with # (like #include <stdio.h>) handle tasks like including header files containing standard functions. 
// 3. Definition Section:
// Defines constants or macros using #define. 
// 4. Global Declarations:
// Variables declared outside any function are accessible throughout the program. 
// 5. main() Function:
// The program's entry point; execution starts here. It includes variable declarations, statements, and possibly function calls. 
// 6. Subprograms:
// User-defined functions that perform specific tasks, enhancing code organization. 
// Key Syntax Elements:
// Header Files: Provide access to standard library functions (e.g., stdio.h for input/output). 
// main() Function: The starting point of execution, int main() { ... }. 
// Semicolons: Statements in C end with a semicolon (;). 
// Curly Braces: Enclose code blocks, such as the body of a function or a conditional statement. 
// Variables: Used to store data, declared with a data type (e.g., int, float, char). 
// Operators: Symbols that perform operations (e.g., +, -, *, /). 
// Control Structures: Manage the flow of execution (e.g., if, else, for, while). 
// Functions: Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. 
// Comments: Used to explain the code; ignored by the compiler.
